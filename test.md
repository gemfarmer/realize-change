### Testing

1. Running the tests manually from a browser
- Open the test/index.html file in a browser. This displays a test page that shows two tests passing.
- Simply refresh the page to run the test suite again.

2. Running the tests headlessly using PhantomJS
- Run `make test` and observe the results on the command line.
